# COVER LETTER
## UK Brand Partner Executive — Healf

Dear Hiring Team,

I'm applying for the UK Brand Partner Executive role because it sits at the exact intersection of what I do well and what I care about — and uniquely, I've worked on both sides of the brand-partner relationship.

**I've been on the brand side.**

I spent nearly three years as a Sales Coordinator at TWG Tea in Singapore — a global luxury brand — managing client accounts and working directly with brand partners and suppliers. I understand how premium brands think about product curation, customer loyalty, and commercial performance, because I've been part of it from the inside. That experience means I can speak the language of Healf's brand partners from day one — not as an outsider, but as someone who's sat in their chair.

**I've managed client portfolios with real commercial accountability.**

At Norstat — Europe's largest data collection agency — I owned revenue targets, negotiated pricing with enterprise clients including Lego, H&M, and IKEA, and was directly responsible for client retention and account growth. When I saw an opportunity to expand a project scope or propose additional services, I took it. That's upselling rooted in understanding what the client actually needs — which is exactly what Healf's brand partners deserve.

Now, as an Account Executive at ProSapient, I manage relationships with consulting firms and PE/VC funds. I run their CRM pipeline, identify upsell opportunities, and coordinate onboarding. Every day, I build trust with demanding, time-sensitive clients who expect sharp thinking and fast execution.

**I'm comfortable with data, and I use it to tell a story.**

I build Excel reports and dashboards to track client KPIs, use Google Analytics to understand engagement, and present commercial insights to stakeholders. I'm not a data scientist — but I know how to look at performance metrics, spot what's working, identify what isn't, and turn that into a clear recommendation a brand partner can act on.

**Wellness is personal, not just professional.**

I actively follow the health and wellness space — not just the headlines, but the brands, the products, the science. I use supplements regularly. I track how products affect my energy and performance. Healf's approach — curating the best across EAT, MOVE, MIND, SLEEP and now closing the loop with Healf Zone — resonates with how I already think about my own wellbeing. This isn't a job where I'd need to fake enthusiasm for the product.

**What I'd bring from day one:**

- Experience managing client portfolios and being accountable for commercial outcomes
- The ability to have honest, trust-based conversations with brands about performance and growth
- Comfort building reports and forecasts from data to give brands visibility
- A work ethic aligned with The Healf Standard — I've consistently worked beyond 9–5 because I care about delivering results, not clocking hours

My path — from brand-side sales coordination at TWG Tea, to commercial account management at Norstat and ProSapient — means I understand how brands think *and* I've developed the skills to be the partner that helps them grow. I know I have more to learn, and that's what excites me about this role: the chance to grow fast in a high-expectation environment doing work I genuinely care about. I learn quickly, I work hard, and I'm ready to earn my place on the Healf team.

I'd love to discuss how my experience can contribute to your Brand Partners team.
