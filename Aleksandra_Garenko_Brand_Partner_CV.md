## WHY HEALF?

My career started on the brand side — at TWG Tea, I spent nearly three years in sales coordination, managing client accounts and working with brand partners. I understand how premium brands think about customer experience, product curation, and loyalty, because I've been part of it from the inside.

Since then, I've taken on more commercial responsibility — owning revenue targets at Norstat (serving brands like Lego, H&M, IKEA) and managing client relationships at ProSapient. I've grown a lot, and I know I have more to learn — which is exactly why Healf's steep learning curve and fast progression appeal to me.

What draws me to Healf is that wellbeing is already part of my daily life — from the supplements I take to the brands I follow. I want to combine my brand-side understanding and client management experience with genuine passion for this space. I'm ready to work hard, learn fast, and help UK wellness brands grow on Healf's platform.
